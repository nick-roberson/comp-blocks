# Comp Blocks

## Description

Framework for organizing and running computation blocks on an input dataframe.

In its infancy but was similar to a project that was worked on in the past. 
The idea is to have a framework that allows for the organization of computation blocks 
that can be run on a dataframe. The computation blocks are organized in a directed 
acyclic graph (DAG) and the framework will run the computation blocks in the correct order.
